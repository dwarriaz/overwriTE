# overwriTE
## Interrogating the influence of Transposable Element (TE) insertions on trasncriptional dynamics   
  
overwriTE dependencies include: mySQL, python3, R (tidyr, ggextra)  
  
By intersecting overwriTE's intermediate .csv file with DEseq2 output, the potential influence of TEs can be quantified and visualized as seen below:
